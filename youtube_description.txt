🔍 RAG & Multi-Agent News Analysis System - Demo

Production-ready system combining Vector RAG, Graph RAG, and Multi-Agent workflows for intelligent news analysis. Perfect for developers and AI enthusiasts.

📋 System Overview:

• Vector RAG: FAISS semantic search with OpenAI embeddings, building vector database from NewsAPI, natural language queries, top-k document retrieval, context-aware answers

• Graph RAG: Neo4j knowledge graphs, knowledge graph from sports teams, lexical graph from news, keyword extraction, complex relationship queries, Cypher optimization

• Multi-Agent: LangGraph workflow with Research Agent (query optimization, news fetching), Analysis Agent (sentiment, importance 1-10, key facts), Summary Agent (comprehensive reports), sequential pipeline, error handling

• Streamlit UI: Modern dashboard, interactive queries, real-time status, progress visualization, expandable results, responsive design

• REST API: FastAPI with OpenAPI docs, Vector/Graph RAG endpoints, multi-agent analysis, health checks, request validation

🛠️ Tech Stack:
LangChain & LangGraph, OpenAI GPT, FAISS, Neo4j, FastAPI, Streamlit, NewsAPI, Python 3.8+

📚 GitHub: https://github.com/yliasolom/graph_search

Includes: source code, setup guide, API docs, examples, tests, environment templates

💡 Features:
✅ Semantic search with vector embeddings
✅ Graph retrieval with Cypher queries
✅ Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
✅ Importance scoring (1-10 scale)
✅ Key facts extraction
✅ Multi-agent automated workflow
✅ Error handling and recovery
✅ REST API access
✅ Web dashboard
✅ Context-aware document retrieval

🎯 Use Cases:
News monitoring, research assistance, content summarization, sentiment tracking, knowledge graph queries, semantic search, multi-source analysis, automated reporting

📖 How It Works:

Vector RAG: NewsAPI → Text chunks → OpenAI embeddings → FAISS storage → Query embeddings → Top-k retrieval → LLM answers

Graph RAG: Structured data → Knowledge graph → News lexical graph → Keyword extraction → Cypher queries → LLM answers

Multi-Agent: Topic → Research Agent (fetch news) → Content extraction → Analysis Agent (sentiment, importance, facts) → Summary Agent (report) → Results

🚀 Getting Started:
Easy setup. GitHub provides installation, configuration, API docs, Python examples, Streamlit guide, troubleshooting.

💻 Customization:
Modular codebase: add agents, extend graphs, customize search, integrate sources, modify UI, add endpoints.

🔐 Requirements:
OpenAI API Key, NewsAPI Key, Neo4j Database, Python environment
